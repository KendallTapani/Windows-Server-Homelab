# Windows-Server-Homelab
This is documentation of a fully setup test environment, with Windows Server 2022, 5+ machines, and 1000+ users in Active directory.


I'm basically showing the process used to set up this environment, including the network setup and configuration I did, as well as the scripting practices I regularly implement in the workplace.
This is meant to be a real world example of the environment I am usually managing.
