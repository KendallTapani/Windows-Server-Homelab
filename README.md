# Windows-Server-Homelab
This is documentation of a fully setup test environment, with Windows Server 2022, 5+ machines, and 1000+ users in Active directory.
I'm basically putting the server setup process, the network setup and configuration I did, both on the server and user end, as well as extensive scripting practices I regularly implement in the workplace.
This is meant to be a real world example of how Windows Server 2022 works. (and all the older versions, lets be honest it hasn't changed much)
