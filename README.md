# Windows-Server-Homelab
This is documentation of a fully setup test environment, with Windows Server 2022, 5+ machines, and 1000+ users in Active directory.
This is basically showing the process used to set up this environment, including the network setup and configuration, as well as the scripting practices I regularly implement in the workplace.
This is meant to be a real world example of a typical company environment.
<br/>
<br/>

### 1. Created Server and Client Machines
- Windows server 2022 with an internal and external network adapter.
- Windows 10 pro client machines, with only an internal network adapter.
